# Project 1: Digit Classification

This project implements a naive Bayesian classifier for a set of scanned handwritten digit images. It guesses which digit a handwritten image is supposed to be. It uses a corpus of training images which have already been labeled with the correct digits to compute the most likely digit for an unclassified image, by breaking the image apart into features and ranking each digit by how closely it matches the image.

All files other than DigitRecognition.hs were given to me by the professor as a testing framework. Most of the DigitRecognition.hs file was written by me, which includes all the algorithms and helper functions necessary for the digit recognition process. The project was tested with Make using test cases given by the professor.
